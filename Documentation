So in this repo you will find a custom designed rover which is basically a box with four wheels and the controls are of the type “skid_steer_drive”.
The rover can be launched in a mars environment (git hub link to the Mars world https://github.com/noiseless47/ros2_rover)
It is also possible to launch the bot in a forest or in a moon environment but our current focus is on Mars...
Also the rover has been integrated with some sensors namely 
1) Depth camera 
2) Camera(optional) 
3) IMU
4) GPS 
5) Lidar(but not using in URC) 

Issues that I faced:
1) The normal diff_drive wouldn't work as those are the controls for a bit with two wheels along with a caster wheel. So when giving the gazebo controls make sure to change it to skid_stree_drive.
2) When I cloned the Mars world I had to install Rtab for launching the command so make sure to run “rosdep install --from-paths src -r -y” before you colcon build your workspace
3) While replacing the rover's urdf(the one in the Mars world git) with my urdf I had to change the path for rsp(robot state publisher) launch file and make sure that the name of the package was also changed in my case urc_rover.

3) For adding IMU and GPS I referred to the official gazebo plugins:
   a) IMU:https://classic.gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_gzplugins
   b) GPS:https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/p/gazebo_plugins/generated/classgazebo__plugins_1_1GazeboRosGpsSensor.html
