So in this repo you will find a custom designed rover 
which is basically a box with four wheels and 
the controls are of the type skid_steer_drive
The rover can be launched in a mars environment 
(git hub link tothe Mars world https://github.com/noiseless47/ros2_rover)
It is also possible to launch the bot in a forest or in a moon environment 
But our current focus is on Mars...
Also the rover has been integrated with some sensors namely 
1)Depth camera 
2)Camera(optional) 
3)IMU
4) GPS 
5) Lidar(but not using in URC)
